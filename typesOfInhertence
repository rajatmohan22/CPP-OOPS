Simple Inheritence
Hierarchical Inheritence
Multilevel Inheritence
Multiple Inheritence
Hybrid (mixing 2 or more types)
    Under this we have:
    -> Multipath Inheritence - Hierarchical+Multiple

         A
        / \
        B  C
        \  /
         D -> this is Multipath. ABC have hierarchical and BCD have Multiple. Here we may have ambiguity issues.
         consider a function fun() declared in A. It is availible to D via B and C. So this is an issue.
